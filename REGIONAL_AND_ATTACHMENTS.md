# Regional Restrictions and Attachment Features

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Regional Restrictions for Topics

Topics can now have regional restrictions at three levels:
- **District Level**: Topic visible only to users in the same district
- **Sector Level**: Topic visible only to users in the same district and sector
- **Cell Level**: Topic visible only to users in the same district, sector, and cell

#### Implementation Details

**Type Definition:**
```typescript
interface Topic {
  // ... existing properties
  regionalRestriction?: {
    level: 'district' | 'sector' | 'cell';
    district?: string;
    sector?: string;
    cell?: string;
  };
}
```

**Regional Badge Component:**
- Color-coded badges indicating restriction level:
  - ðŸ”µ Blue: District level ("Gasabo District Only")
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Sector level ("Nyamirambo Sector Only") 
  - ðŸŸ  Orange: Cell level ("Rweru Cell Only")
- MapPin icon for visual clarity

**Filtering Logic:**
- Automatic filtering based on user's location
- Only shows topics that match user's administrative level
- No regional restriction = visible to all users

#### Supported File Types:
- **Images** (JPG, PNG): Inline preview with thumbnail
- **Videos** (MP4): Video player with thumbnail preview

  if (!topic.regionalRestriction) return true;
  
  const { level, district, sector, cell } = topic.regionalRestriction;
  const userLocation = user.location;
  
  switch (level) {
    case 'district':
      return userLocation.district === district;
    case 'sector':
      return userLocation.district === district && 
             userLocation.sector === sector;
    case 'cell':
      return userLocation.district === district && 
             userLocation.sector === sector && 
             userLocation.cell === cell;
  }
};
```

### Attachment Handling:
- Thumbnail generation for videos and documents
- MIME type detection
- File size formatting

## Usage Examples

This implementation enhances community engagement through location-relevant content and improves information accessibility through rich media support.
