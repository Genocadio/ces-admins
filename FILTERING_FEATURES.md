## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// Issues Section
const [showMyIssuesOnly, setShowMyIssuesOnly] = useState(false);

// Topics Section  
const [showMyTopicsOnly, setShowMyTopicsOnly] = useState(false);
```

### Filtering Logic
```typescript
// Issues filtering
const filteredIssues = issues.filter(issue => {
  const matchesUser = !showMyIssuesOnly || issue.author.id === currentUser?.id;
  return matchesSearch && matchesCategory && matchesStatus && matchesUser;
});

// Topics filtering
const sortedTopics = [...topics].filter(topic => {
  if (!showMyTopicsOnly) return true;
  return topic.author.id === currentUser?.id;
});
```
